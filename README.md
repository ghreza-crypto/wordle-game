<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->

# 📖 Wordle Game Website <a name="about-project"></a>

**Wordle Game**
 is a popular online word puzzle game that challenges players to guess a secret five-letter word within six attempts. The game provides feedback after each guess, indicating which letters are correct and in the right position (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are not in the word at all (gray). With each guess, players strategically narrow down the possibilities until they successfully identify the target word. Wordle is known for its simple yet addictive gameplay, fostering word recognition, vocabulary expansion, and deductive reasoning skills.
